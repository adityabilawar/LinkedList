While LinkedList and ArrayList are both implemented from the List interface.

The ArrayList class has a regular array inside it.
When an element is added, it is placed into the array. 
If the array is not big enough, a new, larger array is created to replace the old one and the old one is removed.

The LinkedList stores its items in "containers." The list has a link to the first container and each container has a link to the next container in the list. 
To add an element to the list, the element is placed into a new container and that container is linked to one of the other containers in the list.
